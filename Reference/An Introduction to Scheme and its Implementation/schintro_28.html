<H4><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="schintro_toc.html#SEC29">Indenting Procedure Definitions</A></H4>

<P>
As we hinted earlier, there's a special rule for indenting procedure
definitions.  You generally indent the body of a procedure a few
characters (we use 3), but you <EM>don't</EM> line the body expressions
up directly under the list of variable names.  If you're using the Emacs
editor, simply terminate each line with linefeed rather than return, and
you will get a good indentation.

</P>
<P>
Don't do this:

</P>

<PRE>
(define (double x)
        (+ x x))
</PRE>

<P>
If you indent this way, a procedure definition looks like a procedure
call, or a normal variable definition.  To make it clearer you're
defining a procedure, do this:

</P>

<PRE>
(define (double x)
   (+ x x))
</PRE>

<P>
This indentation makes it clear that the <CODE>(double x)</CODE> is a
different kind of thing from <CODE>(+ x x)</CODE>.  The former declares how
the procedure can be called, and the latter says what it will do.

</P>

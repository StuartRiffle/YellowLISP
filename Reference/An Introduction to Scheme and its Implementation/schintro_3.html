<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="schintro_toc.html#SEC2">Scheme: A Small But Powerful Language</A></H2>

<P>
Scheme is a clean and fairly small but powerful language, suitable for
use as a general-purpose programming language, a scripting language, an
extension language embedded within applications, or just about anything
else.

</P>
<P>
Scheme was designed to lend itself to a variety of implementation
strategies, and many implementations exist--most of them free software.
For Scheme you'll find straightforward interpreters (similar to simple
interpreters for BASIC or Tcl), compilers to fast machine code (similar
to most compilers for C or Pascal), and compilers to portable
interpretive virtual machine code (similar to most compilers for Java).

</P>
<P>
Several extended implementations of Scheme exist, including our own
RScheme system, an extremely portable implementation of Scheme with
an integrated object system and powerful extensibility features.

</P>
<P>
This book is written in Texinfo format, the format used for GNU
documentation, so that it can be printed out as a hardcopy document,
browsed online as an info document (with the Info browser, or the
Info system for the Emacs editor), or converted automatically to HTML
format for browsing with a web browser.  Whichever way you're reading
this book, welcome to Scheme.

<P>
Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional
features appear necessary.  Scheme demonstrates that a very small number
of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are
composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language
that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming
paradigms in use today.

</P>
<P>
Scheme has influenced the evolution of Lisp.  Scheme
was one of the first programming languages to incorporate first class
procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the usefulness of
static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically typed language.
Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to distinguish procedures
from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a single lexical
environment for all variables, and to evaluate the operator position
of a procedure call in the same way as an operand position.  By relying
entirely on procedure calls to express iteration, Scheme emphasized the
fact that tail-recursive procedure calls are essentially goto's that
pass arguments.  Scheme was the first widely used programming language to
embrace first class escape procedures, from which all known
sequential control structures can be synthesized.  A few of these
innovations have recently been incorporated into Common Lisp, while
others remain to be adopted.

<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="r3rs_toc.html#TOC3">Background</A></H2>

<P>
The first description of Scheme was written in
1975 <A HREF="r3rs_12.html#BIB48">[Scheme75]</A>.  A revised report <A HREF="r3rs_12.html#BIB44">[Scheme78]</A>
 appeared in 1978, which described the evolution
of the language as its MIT implementation was upgraded to support an
innovative compiler <A HREF="r3rs_12.html#BIB41">[Rabbit]</A>.  Three distinct projects began in
1981 and 1982 to use variants of Scheme for courses at MIT, Yale, and
Indiana University <A HREF="r3rs_12.html#BIB30">[Rees82]</A>, <A HREF="r3rs_12.html#BIB23">[MITScheme]</A>, <A HREF="r3rs_12.html#BIB10">[Scheme311]</A>.  An introductory
computer science textbook using Scheme was published in
1984 <A HREF="r3rs_12.html#BIB1">[SICP]</A>.

</P>
<P>
As might be expected of a language used primarily for education and
research, Scheme has always evolved rapidly.  This was no problem when
Scheme was used only within MIT, but as Scheme became more widespread,
local dialects began to diverge until students and researchers
occasionally found it difficult to understand code written at other
sites.

</P>
<P>
Fifteen representatives of the major implementations of Scheme therefore
met in October 1984 to work toward a better and more widely accepted
standard for Scheme.
Participating in this workshop were Hal Abelson, Norman Adams, David
Bartley, Gary Brooks, William Clinger, Daniel Friedman, Robert Halstead,
Chris Hanson, Christopher Haynes, Eugene Kohlbecker, Don Oxley, Jonathan Rees,
Guillermo Rozas, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Mitchell Wand.  Kent Pitman
made valuable contributions to the agenda for the workshop but was
unable to attend the sessions.

</P>
<P>
Subsequent electronic mail discussions and committee work completed the
definition of the language.
Gerry Sussman drafted the section on numbers, Chris Hanson drafted the
sections on characters and strings, and Gary Brooks and William Clinger
drafted the sections on input and output.
William Clinger recorded the decisions of the workshop and
compiled the pieces into a coherent document.
The "Revised revised report on Scheme" <A HREF="r3rs_12.html#BIB4">[RRRS]</A>
was published at MIT and Indiana University in the summer of 1985.
Another round of revision in the spring of 1986, again accomplished almost
entirely by electronic mail, resulted in the present report.

We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community, and so
we grant permission to copy it in whole or in part without fee.  In
particular, we encourage implementors of Scheme to use this report as
a starting point for manuals and other documentation, modifying it as
necessary.

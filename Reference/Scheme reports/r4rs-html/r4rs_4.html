<TITLE>Revised(4) Scheme - Lexical conventions</TITLE>

<H1><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#TOC14">Lexical conventions</A></H1>

<P>
This section gives an informal account of some of the lexical
conventions used in writing Scheme programs.  For a formal syntax of
Scheme, see section section <A HREF="r4rs_9.html#SEC66">Formal syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
Upper and lower case forms of a letter are never distinguished
except within character and string constants.  For example, <CODE>Foo</CODE> is
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
the same identifier as <CODE>FOO</CODE>, and <TT>#x1AB</TT> is the same number as
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<TT>#X1ab</TT>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#TOC15">Identifiers</A></H2>

<P>
Most identifiers allowed by other programming
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
languages are also acceptable to Scheme.  The precise rules for forming
identifiers vary among implementations of Scheme, but in all
implementations a sequence of letters, digits, and "extended alphabetic
characters" that begins with a character that cannot begin a number is
an identifier.  In addition, <CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>-</CODE>, and <CODE>...</CODE> are identifiers. 
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
Here are some examples of identifiers:

</P>


<PRE>

lambda                   q
list-&#62;vector             soup
+                        V17a
&#60;=?                      a34kTMNs
the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings

</PRE>

<P>
Extended alphabetic characters may be used within identifiers as if
they were letters.  The following are extended alphabetic characters:

</P>


<PRE>

+ - . * / &#60; = &#62; ! ? : $ % _ &#38; ~ ^ 
</PRE>

<P>
See section section <A HREF="r4rs_9.html#SEC67">Lexical structure</A> for a formal syntax of identifiers.

</P>
<P>
Identifiers have several uses within Scheme programs:

</P>


<UL>

<LI>

Certain identifiers are reserved for use as syntactic keywords
(see below).

<LI>

Any identifier that is not a syntactic keyword may be used as a
variable (see section see section <A HREF="r4rs_5.html#SEC19">Variables and regions</A>).

<LI>

When an identifier appears as a literal or within a literal
(see section see section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC27">Literal expressions</A>), it is being used to denote a <EM>symbol</EM>
(see section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC48">Symbols</A>).

</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>

</P>

<P>
The following identifiers are syntactic keywords, and should not be used
as variables:

</P>


<PRE>

=&#62;           do            or
and          else          quasiquote
begin        if            quote
case         lambda        set!
cond         let           unquote
define       let*          unquote-splicing
delay        letrec

</PRE>

<P>
Some implementations allow all identifiers, including syntactic
keywords, to be used as variables.  This is a compatible extension to
the language, but ambiguities in the language result when the
restriction is relaxed, and the ways in which these ambiguities are
resolved vary between implementations.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#TOC16">Whitespace and comments</A></H2>

<P>
<EM>Whitespace</EM> characters are spaces and newlines.
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
(Implementations typically provide additional whitespace characters such
as tab or page break.)  Whitespace is used for improved readability and
as necessary to separate tokens from each other, a token being an
indivisible lexical unit such as an identifier or number, but is
otherwise insignificant.  Whitespace may occur between any two tokens,
but not within a token.  Whitespace may also occur inside a string,
where it is significant.

</P>
<P>
A semicolon (<TT>;</TT>) indicates the start of a
comment.  The comment continues to the
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
end of the line on which the semicolon appears.  Comments are invisible
to Scheme, but the end of the line is visible as whitespace.  This
prevents a comment from appearing in the middle of an identifier or
number.

</P>


<PRE>

;;; The FACT procedure computes the factorial
;;; of a non-negative integer.
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1        ;Base case: return 1
        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))

</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="r4rs_toc.html#TOC17">Other notations</A></H2>

<P>
For a description of the notations used for numbers, see
section section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC49">Numbers</A>.

</P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT><TT>. + -</TT></TT>
<DD>
These are used in numbers, and may also occur anywhere in an identifier
except as the first character.  A delimited plus or minus sign by itself
is also an identifier.
A delimited period (not occurring within a number or identifier) is used
in the notation for pairs (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC47">Pairs and lists</A>), and to indicate a
rest-parameter in a  formal parameter list (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC29">lambda expressions</A>).
A delimited sequence of three successive periods is also an identifier.

<DT><TT><TT>( )</TT></TT>
<DD>
Parentheses are used for grouping and to notate lists
(section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC47">Pairs and lists</A>).

<DT><TT><TT>'</TT></TT>
<DD>
The single quote character is used to indicate literal data (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC27">Literal expressions</A>).

<DT><TT><TT>`</TT></TT>
<DD>
The backquote character is used to indicate almost-constant
data (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC38">Quasiquotation</A>).

<DT><TT><TT>, ,@</TT></TT>
<DD>
The character comma and the sequence comma at-sign are used in conjunction
with backquote (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_6.html#SEC38">Quasiquotation</A>).

<DT><TT><TT>"</TT></TT>
<DD>
The double quote character is used to delimit strings (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC57">Strings</A>).

<DT><TT>\</TT>
<DD>
Backslash is used in the syntax for character constants
(section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC56">Characters</A>) and as an escape character within string
constants (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC57">Strings</A>).

<DT><TT><TT>[ ] { }</TT></TT>
<DD>
Left and right square brackets and curly braces
are reserved for possible future extensions to the language.

<DT><TT>#</TT>
<DD>
 Sharp sign is used for a variety of purposes depending on
the character that immediately follows it:

<DT><TT><TT>#t</TT> <TT>#f</TT></TT>
<DD>
These are the boolean constants (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC45">Booleans</A>).

<DT><TT>#\</TT>
<DD>
This introduces a character constant (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC56">Characters</A>).

<DT><TT>#<TT>(</TT></TT>
<DD>
This introduces a vector constant (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC58">Vectors</A>).  Vector constants
are terminated by <TT>)</TT> .

<DT><TT><TT>#e #i #b #o #d #x</TT></TT>
<DD>
These are used in the notation for numbers (section see section <A HREF="r4rs_8.html#SEC53">Syntax of numerical constants</A>).
